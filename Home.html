<p>If you don't like Michael Bay movies, avoid 6 Underground. This is the essence of his work. The film is saturated with action, great frames and a shallow story. No depth, no unnecessary debts. Action, explosions, action, explosions - realized at the highest level. 6 Underground tells the story of a group of ghosts. It is a private unit of specialists in impossible tasks, who are a bit naively trying to heal the world of bad people. They have no names, only numbers - they do not live for the world. They have tons of money behind them and basically endless possibilities. They are almost superheroes without disguises - there is a millionaire, paid killer, parkour master, former CIA agent, etc. The combination is almost perfect and quite efficient mechanism that can handle crisis situations. Unless something really goes wrong. The creators try to show the short history of individual characters in a rather specific way, jumping along the timeline, but it does not matter. Heroes can be liked from the very first minutes of the film. Mainly because 6 Underground has a lot of humor and a set of strong, hit one-liners that release the tension built up by the fast-paced action. Ryan Reynolds, Ben Hardy or Melanie Laurent may not have reached the heights of acting here, but they did their job by creating interesting (if somewhat shallow) heroes who contact the viewer from the very first minutes.</p>
